Python Assignment Operators

in python assignment operator are used to assign values to variables.

List of python assignment Operators:

Operator        Example         Same As
=               x = 5            x = 5
+=              x += 5           x = x + 5
-=              x -= 5           x = x - 5
*=              x *= 5           x = x * 5
/=              x /= 5           x = x / 5
**=             x **= 5          x = x ** 5
%=              x %= 5           x = x % 5
//=             x //= 5          x = x // 5


===Assignment
The assignment operator assign a value to a variable.

x = "Hello World"
print(x)


===Addition Assignment
The addition assignment operators (+= adds the left and right operands
and assigns the sum to he left operand(Variable)
x  = 4
x += 3
print(x)

-- It  can also concatenate strings using this Operator

===Subtraction Assignment
-The subtraction assignment operator(-=) deducts the right operands from left operand and
assign the difference to the left operand (the variable).

x = 4
x -= 3
print(x)

===Multiplication Assignment
The multiplication assignment operator(*=) Multiples the left operand and right operand and assigns the product to th left operand(the variable)
x = 4
x *=3
print(x)

===Division Assignment
The division assignment operator(/=) divides the left operands by the right operand and assigns
the quotient to the left operand(the variable).

----Note the quotient is always a floating point number.
x = 6
x /= 2
print(x)

===Exponentiation Assignment
The exponentiation assignment operator(**=) raise the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the
 result to the left operand
  x =2
  x **= 3
  print (x)

=== Remainder Assignment
The remainder assignment operator(%=) known as modulus operator assigns the reminder to the
variable after dividing the left operand by the right operand.

x = 5
x %= 2
print(x)

===Floor Division Assignment
The floor division assignment operator (//=) rounds down the quotient of tis numerical operands to the nearest
whole number, then assigns it to the left operand.
x = 5
x //= 2
print(x)
