Python Comparison operator

A Comparison operator compares its operands and returns a Boolean value
based on whether the comparison is True or False.

It can be used to compare strings, number,Boolean and other objects.

In Python there are 6 comparison operators:
Operator        Description
==              Equality
!=              inequality
>               Greater than
<               Less than
>=              Greater than or equal to
<=              Less than or Equal


====Equality
The equality operators (==) compare two values and return True if the operands
are equal, otherwise return False.
Print(5 == 5)

x = 5
x == 5
print(x)

x = "Python" == Python
print(x)


====Inequality
The inequality operator (!=) compare two values and returns True if the operands are Not equal, otherwise returns True if The operands are not equal, otherwise return False.
print(10 != 5)
---assign your comparison to a variable
x = 10 != 5
print (x)
----Use operator to compare a strings
x = "python" != "javascript"
print(X)

===Grater Than
The greater than operator (>) returns True if the left operand is grater than the right operand,
otherwise return False.

print(8 > 4)
print(5 > 10)

===Less than
The less than operator (<) return True if the left operand is less than the right operand
otherwise return False
print(10 < 15)
print(20 < 10)

===Greater than or equal to
The greater than or equal to operator(>=) returns True if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right
operand,otherwise returns False.
print(10 >= 15)
print(20 >= 10)
print(5 >= 5)

===Less than or equal to
The less than or equal to operator(>=) returns True if the left operands is less than or equal
 to right operand on otherwise False.
 print(10 <= 15)
 print(20 <= 10)
 print(10 <= 10)
