Python Set

A set is container (also called collection) that is unordered and immutable.

Creating a Set

A set is created by using curly brackets {}.

The objects are place inside those brackets and are separated by commas(,).

cars = {"volve","benze","toyota","honda"}
print(cars)

A set can contain mixed data types, but can not contain mutable items like lists,sets and dictionaries.
 x = {"peter", 23 , True}
 print(x)
=================

==Accessing Items
Unlike lists and tuples, you can Not access the items of a set using indexes.

It is because a set is unordered and not indexed
However,We can use the for loop to access all its items one-by-one.

cars = {"volve", "benze", "toyota", "honda"}
for car in cars:
print (cars)

==Adding item to Set
To add item to set, use the add() or update() method.

The add() method adds one item to a set.
cars = {"volve", "benze", "toyota", "honda"}
cars.add("Range")
print(cars)
=================



===Changing an Item in Set===
The item of a set can Not be changed because a set is immutable or unchangeable.

=Removing an item=
To remove an item from a set,use the remove() method.
you have to specify the value of the item you want to remove.
cars = {"volve", "benze", "toyota", "honda"}
cars.add("benze")
print(cars)

==Discard method=
cars = {"volve", "benze", "toyota", "honda"}
cars.discard("benze")
print(cars)


==The difference between the remove() and discard()==
discard() method is does not raise an error if the specified item is not present.

pop() method remove an item.But it cannot determine which item will be removed because a set is unordered.
cars = {"volve", "benze", "toyota", "honda"}
cars.pop("benze")
print(cars)


===Getting the Lenght of A set====
To get the length or the number of item in a set, use the len() method.
cars = {"volve", "benze", "toyota", "honda"}
print(len(cars))


===Checking if an item Exists===
To check if an item exists in a set, use the in operator.
cars = {"volve", "benze", "toyota", "honda"}
"toyata" in cars
print(cars)
It return True if the item is found,

=====Combine Two Sets====
To combine two sets,Update() method is use.
x = {1,2,3,4,5}
y= {6,7,8}
x.update(y)
print(x)

========Difference of Two Sets======
To get the difference between two sets, use the subtraction operator(-).
x = {1,2,3,4}
y = {3,4,5,6}
print("x-y:",x-y)
print("y-x:",y-x)

===Another Way to Create a Set=====
The way we create our seat above is called literal.
Another way to create a set is to use that set() constructor.
cars = (("volve", "benze", "toyota", "honda"))
print(cars)

==========List of method that can be perform with set=========
1.Access iterm with loops using "FOR"
2.Adding to set Using "add()"
3.Changing using "remove(),discard(),pop()"
4.Getting Length of a set Using "len"
5.Combining Two Sets using "update()"
6.Difference of Two sets using "(-)"
