Python Identity Operators

Identity operator are used to compare two values to determine
 if they point to the same object.

 Python has 2 identity operators:
 Operator       Name
 is             The is Operator
 is not         The is not Operator

 ===The is Operator===
 Is operator return True if both operands point to the same object

 x = [1,2,3]
 y = [1,2,3]
 print (x is y)
 ---is Operator return False because they do NOT point to the same object
==
x =[1,2,3]
y=[1.2,3]
z = x
print(x = z)

====== Is not Operator===
Is not Operator returns True if both operand don not point to the same object.
 x = [1,2,3]
 y = [1,2,3]
 print (x is not y)


x =[1,2,3]
y=[1.2,3]
z = x
print(x is not z)
---- The operator return False because the x and y do not point to same object.
