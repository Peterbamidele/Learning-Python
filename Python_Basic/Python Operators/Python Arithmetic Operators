Python Arithmetic Operator
Arithmetic Operators perform mathematical operation on its numerical operands.

Python has 7 basic Python Arithmetic Operators
+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication
/ division
** exponentiation
% reminder
// floor division

=====Addition Operators
Addition operators(+)returns the sum of its numerical operands.
x = 10
y = 5
print(x + y)

-- It can also be used to concatenate or join strings together.
X = "Hello" + "World"

=====Subtraction Operators
Subtraction operator(-) returns the difference of its numerical operands.
x = 10
y = 5
print(x - y)


=====Multiplication Operator
Multiplication operator(*) returns the product of its numerical operands.
x = 10
y = 5
print(x * y)


=====Division Operator
Division Operator (/) return the quotient of its numerical operands
--Note
the quotient will always be a floating point number.
x = 10
y = 5
print(x / y)

===Exponentiation Operators
exponentiation operator(**) raise the left operands to the power of the right operands
x = 2 ** 3


====Reminder Operator
Reminder Operator(%), also known as the modules operator returns the remainder after
dividing the left operands by the right operands.
X = 5 % 2
print(X)
--- 5 is divide by 2 therefore the quotient is 2  and the remainder is 1.

====Floor Division Operator
Floor division operator (//) rounds down the quotient of the numerical operands to
the nearest whole number.
X = 5//2
print (x)
...the quotient is 2.5.
The result of rounding down 2.5 is 2

====Operator Sequence
Operator sequence describer the order of performed operations in an arithmetic expression.
x = 10 + 3 * 5 = 25
-- Python  follow  the Bodmas pattern in mathematics, Where multiplication and division are done before addition and subtraction.
-Multiplication is first, Division is second,addition is third, and subtraction is last
--- increase we need  a certain operation to be performed first.
---Note
--What if we want addition to be performed first in our prevoius example
---Grouping are used to do that, Grouped expression are performed first before the others.
Use parentheses () to group expressions.
== (10 + 3) * 5
