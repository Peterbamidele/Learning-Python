Python indentation
indentation in python is very important

...in other language like java, javaScripts and C, indentation are only for
readability purpose and compilers don't care about indentations.

in Python ...indentation indicates a block of statements.
Tabs or leading  are used to compute the indentation level of a line.

if 5 > 4:
    x = "Hello World!"
    print(x)

Indentation Error
a block of statements need to have the same indentation level

if 6 > 3:
x = "Hello World"
    print(x)
... will produce an error, because the third line those not have the
same indentation as the second one
