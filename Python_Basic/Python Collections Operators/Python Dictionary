Python Dictionary
A dictionary is an unordered and mutable collection of items.
A dictionary is written with curly brackets.
Each item in a dictionary contains a key/value pair.

person = {
    "first_name": "peter",
    "last_name": "bread Winner",
    "gender": "male",
    "state": "ogun",
    "age": 30
}
print(person)
=== In the above example 5 items
First item has a key name of "first_name" and its value is "john".
Second item has a key name of "last_name" and its value is 'bread Winner".
Third item has a key name of "gender" and its value is "male". etc

=====Accessing Items ======

inside square brackets.

person = {
    "first_name": "peter",
    "last_name": "bread Winner",
    "gender": "male",
    "state": "ogun",
    "age": 30
}
x = person["first_name"]
y = person["last_name"]
z = person["gender"]
a = person["state"]
b = person["age"]
print("First Name",x)
print("Last Name",y)
print("Gender",z)
print("State",a)
